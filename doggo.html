   <h2>Data Analysis</h2>

   <h2> Conclusion </h2>
<br> <p> Can be considered the best pet? <br>
  <br> That is the question that we asked at the beginning of this experiment, and now we have an answer. <br>
   <br> After analyzing the data we have determined that the best pet can be considered a Siberian Husky. <br>
  <br> We made our decision by looking at three common atrributes to dogs. <br>
  <br> These attributes were: general health, intelligence, and friendliness to strangers. <br>
  <br> We found all the dogs that matched these attributes to a high standard. Those dogs were: Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, Vizla, Siberian Husky, and Yorkshire Terrier. <br>
   <br> We then had to choose which of these dogs would be the most ideal. We did this by looking at lifespan and we found that the Siberian Husky, on average, had the longest lifespan at 15 years. <br>
   <br> In conclusion we first had to choose an animal to be our candidate. This animal was a dog. <br>
   <br> After that we looked at breeds of dogs and after analyzing our data we have determined the Siberian Husky to be the best pet. </p> <br>
