   Make sure all the ingredients are spread out evenly as you're going to form as many patties as you like in an equal matter. After making the patties you want to put them on the grill and proceed to cook each side for 5 minutes. This will kill all the basteria as well as getting a nice tender burger ready to eat.</p>
