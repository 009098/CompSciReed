   <h1> These Are 3 of My Hobbies I Enjoy Doing </h1>
   <h2> Video Games </h2>
   <p> Video games are one of the things in my life that takes up a large portion of my time, along with homework. What I enjoy about video games is the myriad of games there are to play. There is no shortage of games that will please you. <br>
      Some my personal favorites are rougelike games, which are, dungeon crawling games with permanent death. One of my favorites is a rougelike called Enter The Gungeon, a bullet hell dungeon crawling with punishing mechanics, that rewards you for playing good, and punishes poor play. <br>
      Another one of my favorite games is called Overwatch. This game is a first person shooter where you work together with 5 other players against 6 other players and attempt to complete the objective, depending upon the gamemode and map you are currently playing. <br>
      What makes video games so fun is the how you can basically get whatever you want out of a video game, with so many companies pumping out new games every year you will never run out of the fun which is video games. <br> </p>

   <h2> Rubik's Cubes </h2>
   <p> Another hobby of mine that I enjoy participating in is solving Rubiks's cubes. I enjoy solving rubik's cubes because you can only continue to get faster, as you progress through solving the cubes it opens up challenges that you've never experienced. <br>
      Originally learning how to solve the rubik's cube was a frustrating thing, it took many days, heck weeks even, to get a better undersatnding of how the cube actually worked, but when you finally get to solve it for the first time, it's a beautiful thing. <br>
      Rubik's cubes have such a plethora of options on how you're going to solve it and finding the fasest method and one that fits you is the key to bringing you solve time down, and at the same time, it feels hella good when you solve a rubik's cube in front of a crowd. <br>
      There are many different kinds of rubik's cubes and this opens up the pain excrutiating process of learning the algorithms and getting you muscle memory to continally respond to that situation. Rubik's cubes are a fun, but very frustrating hobby, but once you invest the time, you never look back again.. <br> </p>

   <h2> Origami </h2> 
   <p> The last hobby I will talk about is origami. Origami is, like rubik's cubes, a frustrating, but a rewarding hobby to invest your time into. Origami is the type of hobby where you'll continually wonder why you do this to yourself right up till the moment you finish folding. <br>
      Starting origami is one of the easiest hobbies to start, all you need is some paper, maybe scissors and basic motor skills. It's something that will only take some basic instructions and then after you're done muscle memory takes over every time you want to make a new project. <br>
      Of all the hobbies that I do, origami is one of the most relaxing, folding the paper over and over, it makes it look like a mess, but when you get that last fold down, crisp and clean, it turns into something beautiful and that you can be proud of. <br>
      Origami is like anything else. You'll invest time in it, you'll curse yourself for doing it, you'll hate it with all your soul, but eventually you just learn to love it for what it is. A beautiful hobby that you can be proud you invested all that time into it. <br> </p>
