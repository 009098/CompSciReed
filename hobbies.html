   <h1> These are 3 of my hobbies I enjoy doing </h1>
   <h3> Video Games </h3>
   <p> lass="hobbies"> Video games are one of the things in my life that takes up a large portion of my time, along with homework.   What I enjoy about video games is the myriad of games there are to play. There is no shortage of games that will please you. <br>
      Some my personal favorites are rougelike games, which are, dungeon crawling games with permanent death. One of my favorites is a rougelike called Enter The Gungeon, a bullet hell dungeon crawling with punishing mechanics, that rewards you for playing good, and punishes poor play. <br>
      Another one of my favorite games is called Overwatch. This game is a first person shooter where you work together with 5 other players against 6 other players and attempt to complete the objective, depending upon the gamemode and map you are currently playing <br>
      What makes video games so fun is the how you can basically get whatever you want out of a video game, with so many companies pumping out new games every year you will never run out of the fun which is video games. <br> </p>
