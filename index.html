    <h2> A lil' bit bout' myself.</h2>
   <p class="p1">
  I'm quite the coolio bean guy. Not much to be said here. This is my little portfoilio for le computer science class. <br>
  Shall we get right into what will be presented on this website? <br>
  So on this website we shall have: projects I'm working on, and some other stuff. <br>
  Alright so I could go into a little spiel about my life and tell my life story from the moment I left the womb, but that wouldn't be any fun, now would it? <br>
  So instead I'll give you a picture of some skittles, they're are pretty good candy.

    <p> This is a bag of skittles. <br>
    Skittles taste very great, except the new sour apple flavor, yuck! <br>
    Skittles are good in moderation, you don't want to be bloated after eating a lot of sugar! <br>
    One of the worst things you can do with skittles is bring too much. <br>
    Here's a little example of why too many skittles is too much. <br>
    Once upon a time there was a person who decided he was quite bored with his life. In his boredom he decided to sweeten up his life. <br>
    In his quest to become a glucose filled monster he decided to order 12 54oz bags of skitles, for those who can't do the conversions, that is 40lbs. <br>
    After acquiring this mass of madness he brought it to school for the day. The moment he arrived he was treated like a king, probably because everybody wanted some of that good candy. <br>
    This behavior proceeded all the way until Lunch, where the evil and monsterous monster known as Imk arrived and took away his skittles.
    And then he didn't live happily ever after. <br>
    Skittles... Good in moderation, not so much in the bulk. <br>
