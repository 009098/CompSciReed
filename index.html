    <h2> A lil' bit bout' myself.</h2>
   <p>
  I'm quite the coolio bean guy. Not much to be said here. This is my little portfoilio for le computer science class. <br>
  Shall we get right into what will be presented on this website? <br>
  So on this website we shall have: projects I'm working on, and some other stuff. <br>
  Alright so I could go into a little spiel about my life and tell my life story from the moment I left the womb, but that wouldn't be any fun, now would it? <br>
  So instead I'll give you a picture of some skittles, they're are pretty good candy.

    <p> This is a bag of skittles. <br>
    Skittles taste very great, except the new sour apple flavor, yuck! <br>
    Skittles are good in moderation, you don't want to be bloated after eating a lot of sugar! <br>
    One of the worst things you can do with skittles is bring too much. <br>
    Here's a little example of why too many skittles is too much. <br>
    Once upon a time there was a person who decided he was quite bored with his life. In his boredom he decided to sweeten up his life. <br>
    In his quest to become a glucose filled monster he decided to order 12 54oz bags of skitles, for those who can't do the conversions, that is 40lbs. <br>
    After acquiring this mass of madness he brought it to school for the day. The moment he arrived he was treated like a king, probably because everybody wanted some of that good candy. <br>
    This behavior proceeded all the way until Lunch, where the evil and monsterous monster known as Imk arrived and took away his skittles.
