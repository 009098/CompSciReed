    <h1> Dylan Dipasupil's Portfolio </h1>
    <h2> A lil' bit bout' myself.</h2>
   <p>
  I'm quite the coolio bean guy. Not much to be said here. This is my little portfoilio for le computer science class. <br>
  Shall we get right into what will be presented on this website? <br>
  So on this website we shall have: projects I'm working on, and some other stuff. <br>
  Alright so I could go into a little spiel about my life and tell my life story from the moment I left the womb, but that wouldn't be any fun, now would it? <br>
  So instead I'll give you a picture of some skittles, they're are pretty good candy.

    <p> This is a bag of skittles. <br>
    Skittles taste very great, except the new sour apple flavor, yuck! <br>
