  <h1>What makes the perfect skittle?</h1>
  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>To collect the data we tried one skittle at a time until we had tasted 100 skittles and their qualities. Then we judged how the skittles tasted on a rating system 1-5. The qualities we judged were the visibility of the S, the condition of the shell and the juicness of the skittle. Here is a snippet of our data collection that we took.</p>

   <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
  <p>Some patterns we found were the averages of visiblity of the S, condition of the shell and the juiciness of the skittle these are the
    averages:  Visiblity: 2.9, Condition: 3.9, Juiciness 3.6. We then found how often each ranking occurred. For the visibility of the S we found there were: 15 zeros, 7 ones, 13 twos, 17 threes, 23 fours and 25 fives. For the condition of the shell there were: 2 zeros, 3 ones, 5 twos, 18 threes, 36 fours and 36 fives. Finally, for the juicness there were: 3 zeros, 1 one, 16 twos, 29 threes, 18 fours and 27 fives. </p>
